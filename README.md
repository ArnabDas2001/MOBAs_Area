<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great websites on the internet but was missing this awesome website about the MOBA genre. So, I started creating this website for fun and also to learn many things about frontend web development. This website features links to many other famous MOBA game websites out there.

Here I have added the glass morphism effect, parallax effect, sign-up/sign-in overlay function, star.js function, and carousel features too. Hope this is it but if any more features you think will be good then please do suggest them.ðŸ˜Š

Of course, no website will serve every aspect since needs may be different from others. So I may be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by opening an issue.

[Note: This website is not responsive for smaller screen sizes like mobile devices yet. So, I suggest viewing this only on a desktop or laptop]
