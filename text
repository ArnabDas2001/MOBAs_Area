            <h2 style="color: #2d01a8;">Play Style</h2>
            <p>A key part of playing MOBA games is familiarizing yourself with the features that such titles tend to have. It is very common for MOBAs to involve:
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="list1">
                <ul>
                    <li>Players joining forces in groups of four or five to take on other teams</li>
                    <li>Action on a map that features several "lanes" and uncharted "jungle" between teams' bases</li>
                    <li>The objective of breaching the enemy's defense and destroying their base</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <br>
            Just like many other MMOs, playing MOBAs tends to be historically linked with PC gameplay. However, the rising popularity of the genre means that many titles can now be played on other platforms, including mobile and consoles.

            <h2 style="color: #2d01a8;">First MOBA Game</h2>
                <p>There is no simple answer to the question of which title could be regarded as the first MOBA. A name which pops up regularly, however, is Aeon of Strife.

                    Created as a custom map for the original version of Starcraft, which was released back in 1998, Aeon of Strife is seen by many as the gaming experience which gave birth to the core elements which we now associate so strongly with MOBA gaming.
                    
                    While the Defense of the Ancients – or DotA – map designed for Warcraft III in the early 2000s was also a key moment for the genre, Aeon of Strife undoubtedly deserves a huge amount of credit.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: #2d01a8;">MOBAs and eSports</h2>
<p>The idea of playing video games for a living might seem like a teenager’s dream, but the ever-growing world of eSports has made that a reality for some of the most talented gamers on the planet. Professional competitive gaming sees players do battle on a range of titles, with MOBAs forming a fundamental part of the scene.
Competitions related to the likes of League of Legends and Dota 2 tend to have major amounts of prize money on offer, with winning sides often securing multimillion dollar sums for coming out on top. ESports are edging ever closer to the mainstream, and that in turn means that MOBAs could soon be bigger than ever before.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="color: #2d01a8;">MOBAs on mobile</h2>
<p>The MOBA genre is commonly linked to the world of PCs. However, the emergence of smartphones and tablets as platforms which can offer a high quality gaming experience means that a host of top games are now available for those who are regularly on the move.In fact, while PC games can be quite tough to initially get to grips with, the accessibility of mobile gaming means that the platform is often a fairly simple way for people to take their first steps into the world of MOBA gaming, especially in terms of simplified controls.</p>
